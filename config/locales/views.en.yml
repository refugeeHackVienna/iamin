          The purpose of "where2help" (w2h) is to provide potential voluntary helpers with a clear overview of voluntary services required by organisations/initiatives.

          w2h is aimed at bringing together demand from organisations/initiatives and supply from voluntary helpers in the best possible way.

          w2h is operated by the Vienna Social Fund (Fonds Soziales Wien – FSW).

          The operator does not assume liability for contents generated by users.

          The use of w2h requires registration.

          By registering with w2h you agree to the processing of the data you have disclosed (your personal data) for the purpose stated above and to the transfer of your data to registered users. You also agree that information related to your voluntary work will be sent to your organisation/initiative, especially when urgent help is needed.

          When registered with w2h, voluntary helpers have accident and liability insurance for their voluntary work, excluding professional or paid activities and voluntary work for associations or organisations/initiatives which offer their own accident and liability insurance package to their volunteers. Organisations/initiatives undertake to record all assignments, specifying volunteers’ names, location of the assignment, type of activity, date and time, and, in the event of damage, to notify the operator immediately and forward the details of the relevant assignment to <a href="mailto:contact@where2help.wien">contact@where2help.wien</a>.

          FSW reserves the right not to admit organisations/initiatives to the w2h platform for good cause.

          FSW further reserves the right to exclude already registered organisations/initiatives from w2h for good cause and to modify or discontinue w2h at any time without prior notice and without giving reasons, particularly if this is required on legal and/or technical grounds.

          Registration does not give rise to any claim for the use of w2h or the assignment of voluntary helpers.

          You can cancel your registration and the processing of your data by w2h at any time without giving reasons by clicking <a href="https://www.fsw.at/kontaktformular" target="_blank">here</a>.

          You can exercise your rights to information, correction or deletion of data, limitation of data processing, objection and data portability by clicking <a href="https://www.fsw.at/kontaktformular" target="_blank">here</a>.

          In addition, you may make a complaint with the competent supervisory authority (data protection authority).

          We will store your personal data only for as long as we deem necessary to meet the purposes stated above and as permitted under applicable law. In any case, we will store your personal data for the statutory retention period or until the statute of limitation for potential legal claims has expired.
